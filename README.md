# SimpleLauncher
A simple app to allow SimpleHelp to simply run as root on macOS.

This project is the definition of As-Is.

Notes:
    Make sure your download preferences make it into /Library/Preferences/com.github.remoteaccess.plist (everything is a string, no bool!)
    Signed, but not notorized
    Use munkipkg to build deployable package after editing the preinstall script.

Cheers.Peet
