# SimpleLauncher
**2020.19.02 - Completely reworked and seems to work well now.**

A simple app to allow SimpleHelp to simply run as root on macOS.

This project is the definition of As-Is.

Notes:
* Make sure your download preferences make it into /Library/Preferences/com.github.remoteaccess.plist (everything is a string, no bool!)
* Signed, but not notorized
* Edit variables in preinstall script for munkipkg
* Use munkipkg to build deployable package after editing the preinstall script.
* Test it on a VM or two.
* Profit?

Cheers.Peet
